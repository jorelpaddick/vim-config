# My Vim Configuration
 
## Why use this config?
It's the easy way to instantly improve your vim environment!
You can extend it later when you have the time... and more coffee.

## How to use this config:

1. Download this zip, or clone this repository on your system.
2. Run the included install script. (You can save your existing configuration)
3. Run vim.

That's it!

## Plugins Used in this Config

Plugins are managed by Pathogen which is super easy to use.
To add your own vim plugins simply simply clone their git repo or
unzip them in ~/.vim/bundle and pathogen will handle the rest.

for example to enable the nerdtree plugin:

    'cd ~/.vim/bundle'
    
    'git clone https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree.git'

That's it!
